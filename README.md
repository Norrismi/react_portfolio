## Reflection

The biggest take away from this project was, it's always good to have a wireframe or solid idea of a project before you get started. I spent too much time on items such as the navigation bar layout design and content design for the homepage. In the end, I am happy with how the project turned out.   
<br />

To be honest, the webpage background color is something I have struggled with on every project I have created. With this being a portfolio project, I really felt the need for the background to pop. One day on television, a commercial advertisement for a website caught my eye. At the time, I had no idea what to even call the design. After several attempts of asking questions on Stack Overflow and Reddit, I finally found what I was looking for, it was a SVG background. I found some cool sites online to help generate the design and color patterns. Within react and css, it took some time to fine tune the design, but I finally got the design down and I am happy. I really think it helps to make the design pop.

## Available Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about running tests for more information.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`


Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!<br />

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at<br /> any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.<br /><br />

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies<br /> (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over <br />them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the<br /> copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.<br /><br />

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and<br /> middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we<br /> understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when<br /> you are ready for it.<br /><br />
